1.NUMBER GAME:
The NUMBER GAME project in Java involves a number guessing game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game begins by initializing variables for player details, rounds, and scores. Players set a maximum number of attempts for each round and are welcomed with round information. A guessing loop allows players to make guesses and receive feedback on their accuracy. The game tracks attempts, reveals the target number after the guessing loop, and calculates scores based on the chosen scoring method (attempts taken or rounds won). At the end of each round, players are prompted to play again, and the final score is calculated based on total rounds won and average attempts per round. The game concludes with a summary of the player's performance.

2.GRADE CALCULATOR:
This Java program calculates grades and provides feedback for multiple students based on their subject marks. It utilizes a Scanner object to input student information and subject marks. After gathering data for each student, it calculates total marks and average percentage, then assigns a grade and provides remarks accordingly. The calculated grade () method determines the grade based on the average percentage, while the get Remarks () method provides feedback based on the grade achieved. Overall, this program efficiently handles multiple students' data, calculates their grades, and delivers personalized remarks based on their performance.

3.ATM INTERFACE:
This Java program simulates an ATM interface for managing a bank account, showcasing fundamental principles of object-oriented programming, user input handling, and error checking. The BankAccount class defines a basic bank account with methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking, ensuring an initial balance of at least $500. The ATM class provides a user-friendly interface with options to withdraw, deposit, check the balance, or exit, and its run() method continuously presents the menu and processes user input until exit is chosen. Methods like performWithdrawal() and performDeposit() handle user transactions by validating and updating the account balance, while displayBalance() shows the current balance. The getValidAmountInput() method ensures accurate and positive input values. The main() method initializes the bank account with $1000 and launches the ATM interface, offering a simple yet functional experience for managing bank accounts.
